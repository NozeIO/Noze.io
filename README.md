"Das Haus das Verr√ºckte macht."

**Noze.io** is an attempt to carry over the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
ideas into *pure* [Swift](http://swift.org).
It uses [libdispatch](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch)
for event-driven, non-blocking I/O.
**Noze.io** is built around type-safe back-pressure aware pull-streams
(using Swift generics)
operating on batches of items. Instead of just operating on bytes,
operate on batches of Unicode lines or database records or HTML
responses or - you get the idea.
Be efficient: Stream everything and √üatch.

A focus is to keep the API similar to Node. Not always possible -
Swift is not JavaScript - but pretty close.
It comes with rechargeables included, **Noze.io** is self-contained and
doesn't require any extra dependencies.
It includes modules such as
[cows](Sources/cows),
[leftpad](Sources/leftpad),
[express](Sources/express) or
[redis](Sources/redis).

**Noze.io** works in Cocoa environments as well as on Linux.

*Is it a good idea?* You [tell us](http://noze.io/about/).
Not sure, but we think it might be, because:
*a)* While Swift looks *very* much like JavaScript, it is actually a very
high performance statically typed and AOT-compiled language,
*b)* Code often looks better in Swift, mostly due to trailing-closure syntax,
*c)* No monkey patching while still providing extensions.
~~There are cons too.~~

#### Shows us some code!

There is a reasonably large collection of simple, focused:
[Noze.io examples](Samples)
But here you go, the "standard" Node example, a HelloWorld httpd:
```swift
import http

http.createServer { req, res in 
  res.writeHead(200, [ "Content-Type": "text/html" ])
  res.end("<h1>Hello World</h1>")
}
.listen(1337)
```
An echo daemon, just piping the in-end of a socket into its own-out end:
```swift
import net

net.createServer { sock in
  sock.write("Welcome to Noze.io!\r\n")
  sock | sock
}
.listen(1337)
```
More complex stuff including a 
[Todo-MVC backend](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/blob/master/Samples/todo-mvc-redis/main.swift)
can be found in the
[Noze.io examples](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Samples).

### Supported Swift Versions

| tuxOS | [3.1](https://swift.org/download/#releases) | | üëçüèª  | üëç  |

With the release of Swift 3 Noze.io drops support for Swift 2.x. If you
are still interested in using it with 2.x, the last release is still available
in the `legacy/swift23` branch on GitHub.

### Status

- We chose the traditional Swift approach:
  Make something barely usable, though demoable,
  and release it with a 3.0 version tag.
  Then hope that the community kicks in and fills open spots.
  Well kinda. It's pretty good already! üòâ

- It already has
  [leftpad](Sources/leftpad).
  As well as [cows üêÆ](Sources/cows/README.md)!

- Implements primarily the happy path. Errors will error. Presumably this
  will improve over time.

- A huge strength of Node is the npm package environment and the
  <a href="http://heathersfilm.tripod.com/script.txt" target="ext">myriad</a>s 
  of packages available for it.
  Or wait, is it? Well, at least we have
  [leftpad](Sources/leftpad)
  included.
  And we hope that the [Swift package](https://swift.org/package-manager/)
  environment is going to grow as well.

- There are tons of open ends in Noze.io. We welcome contributions of all kinds.

### Who

Noze.io is brought to you by
[The Always Right Institute](http://www.alwaysrightinstitute.com)
and
[ZeeZide](http://zeezide.de).
We wouldn't be sad if more people would like to join the effort :-)
