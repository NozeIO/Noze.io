Inspired by
[swiftmon](https://github.com/dimpiax/swiftmon).
But in Swift.
Hence the S. Like in *S*uper. Or *S*porty. Or *S*chwifty. Or *S*wifty.
Your choice.

What does it do? It automatically invokes `swift build` within a Swift Package Manager
project when files in the Sources folder are modified/added/deleted. Improving your
workflow if you don't use an IDE (no manual calls to `swift build` necessary).

## Requirements

Swift 3.0, or better. macOS. (Sorry, no Linux yet)

## Building

swift build

## Installing

sudo cp ./.build/debug/swiftmons /usr/local/bin
