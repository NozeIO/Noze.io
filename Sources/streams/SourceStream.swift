/// A GCD based Readable stream. Similar but not exactly the same like a Node.JS
/// streams2 Readable object.
///
/// All the buffering logic is in `ReadableStream`, the `Readable` is solely
/// connecting a `GReadableSourceType` to the _primaryRead() implementation
/// of the ReadableStream.
/// In essence, a `GReadableSourceType` is nothing but an asynchronous
/// generator.
///
/// * How to use as a client/consumer
///
/// Sample:
///   let stream = StdinSource().readable()
///   stream.onEnd      { print("stream processing is done ...") }
///   stream.onError    { print("catched error: \($0)") }
///   stream.onReadable {
///     let bucket = stream.read() // nil on EOF
///     print("got bucket of data: \(bucket)")
///   }
///
/// Explained:
/// - the readable() function wraps a ReadableSource, in this case the
///   StdinSource, in a Readable stream
/// - the onEnd callback is called when the stream hit EOF *and* all data from
///   the internal buffers has been read
/// - the onError block is called, well, on errors :-)
/// - the onReadable is called when the Readable has data in its internal
///   buffers which the client can read from w/o blocking. Or on EOF.
///   NOTEs:
///   - there really should be only one subscriber for Readable events, or
///     at least only one party should actually read() from it
///   - setting the first onReadable callback will schedule the source for
///     reading (i.e. files will get opened, the first blocks will get read)
///
/// * Adding a new type of stream
///
/// Unlike in Node.JS there is no _read() primary function. Instead implement a
/// ReadableSource object. See the protocol's documentation for further 
/// information on how to do this.
///
///
/// * Differences to Node.JS:
/// - This Readable doesn't actually implement the underlying _read()
///   implementation, but defers that to a 'ReadableSourceType'
/// - The Readable can deal with sets of any type (not just bytes, but e.g. 
///   lines, or records as well). While Node.JS also has an 'object mode',
///   this works on a 'per item' basis.
/// - We do not support streams1 'data' events to avoid confusion what should
///   be used. Maybe we should change that, easy enough.
///
/// I originally called this BufferedReadablePullStream, but renamed that back
/// to Readable to be more in line with Node.
