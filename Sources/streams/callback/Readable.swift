/// A callback based `ReadableStream`, that is, you don't need to subclass, you
/// can just use this.
///
/// A `Readable` doesn't even have to have a `_read` callback. You can
/// instantiate it and just `push` to it, like so:
///
///    let rs = Readable<UInt8>()
///    rs.push("beep ")
///    rs.push("boop\n")
///    rs.push(nil) // EOF
///    rs | process.stdout
///
/// Note that all pushes are put into the buffer and will be written even though
/// an EOF got pushed.
///
/// But quite often you don't want to buffer stuff but rather behave like a
/// generator (only produce output if someone is actually reading).
/// If you already have a `Generator` (or `Iterator`) you can use the
/// `GeneratorSource` in Noze. Like so:
///
///    myGenerator.readableSource()
///
/// If you don't, you can use this stream with a callback, like so:
///
///    let rs = Readable<UInt8>()
///
///    var c : UInt8 = 97
///    rs._read = {
///      rs.push([c])
///      c += 1
///      if c > 122 /* 'z' */ { rs.push(nil) }
///    }
///    rs | process.stdout
///
/// This will only generate items when `stdout` has buffer space to consume
/// them (that is, on-demand).
///
